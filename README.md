# BurnRT fuse ROM programmer

 This is a programmer for old OTP fuse PROM chips. Developed and tested with russian
556РТ (556RT) series, however should also be able to work with Western analogs.

 The project has been restored from old P-CAD sources, shared on the original project
forum (https://zx-pk.ru/threads/15617-programmator-ppzu-155re3-556rt4-i-drugikh ;
russian language).

Current versions:

* Hardware v2.3
* Software v2.0
* Firmware v1.1

Unfortunately at the moment only a binary version of the software for Windows OS is available.

# Distribution

There was originally no clear license terms defined. I asked at least one of original authors
of the schematic; he was not against me opensourcing the design. I am not a fan of this legal
stuff; let's consider it public domain. Any improvements are welcome; i will gladly accept them
into the repository.
